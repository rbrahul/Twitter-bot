# Twitter-weather-update-bot
A Twitter bot which waits for #hashTag and sends weather update of city via tweets to the user

#How it Works

### Step 1:
User tweets to get weather update using hashTag **#DhakaWeather**  such as:

![Seeking Weather Update of Dhaka](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rbrahul/Twitter-weather-update-bot/master/public/images/Seeking-weather-update.png "Seeking Weather Update of Dhaka")


### Step 2:
The twiter weather BOT always filters hashTag **#DhakaWeather**. And when ueser tweets this hastag ths BOT automatically responds him back with Weather information. For Example:

![Twitter Weather BOT responded back with information to the user](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rbrahul/Twitter-weather-update-bot/master/public/images/twitter-bot-respone.png "Twitter Weather BOT responded back with information to the user")

#Tweets Monitoring
You can see all the tweets and response to tweets with their details in Tweets Monitoring panel. (Page Refreshing needed, Ajax not Implemented)


![Twitter Weather BOT keeps trak of all the tweets to monitor](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rbrahul/Twitter-weather-update-bot/master/public/images/screenshot-of-posts.png "Twitter Weather BOT keeps trak of all the tweets to monitor")

#### Detail view of tweets

#Installation

### Create a Twitter Application
Go to https://apps.twitter.com/ and create a new Application. Then you will get consumer key, secret and access_token


### Get Weather API Key:
Go to http://openweathermap.org/appid. If you don't have account yet you need to sign up to get free API Key. Their's APIs are really awesome. Don't hasitate.

### Create MySQL Database:
Create a mysql database named as **twitter_bot**. or anything else. Then import the database schema from **database.sql** file from your project root directory.

####Change Configuration:
After completing above steps please change the configuration file with your own App specific Information
In **src\utils\config.js**:

```js
module.exports.tweeterConfig = {
    consumer_key: 'YOUR_consumer_key',
    consumer_secret: 'YOUR_consumer_secret',
    access_token_key: 'YOUR_access_token_key',
    access_token_secret: 'YOUR_access_token_secret'
};


module.exports.database = {
    host: 'localhost',
    user: 'root', // replace the user name with your own
    password: 'YOUR_DB_PASSWORD', // replace the password with your own
    database: 'twitter_bot'
};

module.exports.APILocationInfo = {
    weatherAPIKEY: '240fae0e48fd82c8f35f6657c96496e4',
    hashTag: '#DhakaWeather', // you may replace it with your own
    cityID: '1337179', //This id denotes Dhaka, Bangladesh. To replace with your one get it from openweather.org
    cityNamye: 'Dhaka' // This City Name will be used when response back to the tweets. You may change it
};
```

###Final Stage:
I think you have successfully configured these information. If everything goes well run following line in your Terminal or Command Line Tools from project directory:

```sh
$ npm start
```
Then go to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) and visit. At first you will get a blank table. But when someone tweets using your **#hashTag** the system will response him back and save to your database.
You have to refresh your page to see the lates tweets.

#Note
Twitter application has some strict rules. As a result your app may be down for a short period while developing if you restart your server freequently or execute your twitter connection related codes.
If you find any error related to status then read the twitter [API Error and Response Status](https://dev.twitter.com/overview/api/response-codes) document.
